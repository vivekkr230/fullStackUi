            While we tend to think of medical professionals as the providers of health care, in reality the vast majority of all care is provided by people for themselves and their families. Increasing our competence for and confidence in self-care may well be the most important function of any health care system.

        <p>
            When the health care system is described, patients are often viewed primarily as passive consumers of health care and health professionals as active providers of services to improve health. The usual image of the health care system is a pyramid with specialists (e.g. surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, etc.) at the top and primary care (e.g. family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc.) at the bottom. This incomplete image of the health care system is, in reality, only the professional care segment. Professional care is just the tip of an iceberg with the much larger system of lay health care or self-care submerged beneath the surface and hidden from view.
